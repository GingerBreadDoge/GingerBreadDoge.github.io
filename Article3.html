                            Topic: Westward Settlement, <br> People are moving more westward for a better future. People came together to establish this ordinance to guide the journey with values of fairness, security, and harmonious growth. By following these principles, we strive to build a vibrant tapestry of communities across the plains and mountains, where opportunity unfolds for all. Native American territories shall be respected and protected, and their treaties shall be honored with the utmost transparency. Public lands will be made accessible through fair auctions, prioritizing smaller farms and family ownership. A portion of the proceeds will be dedicated to nurturing public education and building essential infrastructure, paving the way for stable and thriving communities. To cultivate a spirit of civic engagement, territories will initially be guided by a governor and judges appointed by Congress. As a territory's population reaches five thousand, the right to elect a representative legislature and draft a constitution will blossom. Once sixty thousand souls call the land home, statehood shall be granted, provided a constitution embraces the fundamental principles enshrined in the heart of our nation. Freedom of faith and expression and the right to a fair trial. Recognizing the vital role of knowledge and connection, each township shall dedicate a portion of its land to the establishment of public schools, where getting an education is easier. Congress, in its dedication to progress, will allocate funds for constructing roads, bridges, and canals, weaving a web of connection across the vast expanse. Military outposts shall stand as sentinels, safeguarding settlers from external threats and fostering peaceful coexistence with neighboring Native American tribes. People are now settling more and more in the west.
